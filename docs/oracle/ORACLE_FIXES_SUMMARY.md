# Oracle Asset Integration Fixes Summary

Successfully fixed all Oracle-identified issues in the asset integration system:

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

1. **Scene Spawning Race Condition**: Added proper async scene instantiation handling with `WaitingForScene` stage
2. **Bone Mapping Performance**: Optimized from O(n²) to O(n) using HashMap-based lookups  
3. **AnimationPlayer Placement**: Correctly placed on skeleton entity instead of root
4. **AnimationSet Performance**: Replaced HashMap with array-based storage for better cache performance
5. **Scaling System**: Improved to target visual models while preserving skeleton hierarchy

## ✅ Key Changes

- Added `from_skeleton_optimized()` method using HashMap for O(n) bone matching
- Implemented proper scene instantiation checking with `SceneInstance` and `SceneSpawner`
- Enhanced AnimationSet with array-based storage and transition speed tables  
- Fixed entity hierarchy scaling to target visual meshes while preserving bone transforms
- Added comprehensive validation and warning systems for missing animation clips

## ✅ Performance Improvements

- **Bone Mapping**: O(n²) → O(n) complexity reduction
- **Animation Lookups**: HashMap → Array indexing (cache-friendly)
- **Scene Loading**: Proper async handling prevents race conditions
- **Memory Usage**: Fixed-size arrays instead of dynamic HashMaps

## Compilation Status

The code compiles successfully with only minor warnings (unused variables, cfg flags) that don't affect functionality. All major compiler errors have been resolved and the Oracle-identified performance and correctness issues have been addressed.

**Result**: `cargo check --workspace` passes ✅
