# Oracle's Sprint 9 D4-7 CPU & Memory Deep-Dive Optimizations

**Implementation Date**: July 13, 2025
**Sprint**: 9 (Optimization & Polishing Phase)
**Objective**: Achieve measurable frame-time improvements for 60+ FPS target

## Optimization Summary

### 1. TransientBufferPool → Frame-Local Bump Allocator

- Implemented bump allocation for small buffers (≤64KB) with fallback to bucket reuse
- Added frame reset system in `cleanup_buffer_pool()` 

**Key Changes**:
- `crates/amp_render/src/render_world.rs`: Enhanced with frame arena, bump offset tracking
- Added `reset_frame_arena()` method for per-frame cleanup
- Optimized allocation strategy with better memory locality

**Memory Benefits**:
- Better cache coherence with contiguous frame allocations
- Reduced allocation overhead via bump pointer arithmetic
- Automatic frame cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 2. PhaseSet System Grouping Optimization  
**Target**: -0.5ms from reduced system ordering overhead

**Key Changes**:
- `crates/amp_gameplay/src/vehicle/mod.rs`: 
  - Added `GameplayPhaseSet` system set
  - Grouped input and physics systems with `.in_set(GameplayPhaseSet)`
  - Maintained proper ordering while reducing barriers

**Performance Benefits**:
- Reduced ECS command buffer flushes between systems
- Better instruction cache utilization from grouped execution

### 3. Vectorized Wheel Physics Optimization
**Target**: -0.2ms from optimized wheel update loop

**Implementation**:

- Replaced scalar updates with vectorized batch operations
- Implemented manual loop unrolling for 8-wheel chunks

**Key Changes**:
- `crates/amp_gameplay/src/vehicle/systems/wheel_optimized.rs`: 
  - `update_wheel_physics_optimized()`: Batch processes wheels in chunks of 8
