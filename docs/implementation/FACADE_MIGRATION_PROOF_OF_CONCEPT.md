# Facade Crate Migration - Proof of Concept

## Summary

Successfully implemented facade crate migration for the Amp game engine, starting with the camera system as a proof of concept.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced amp_foundation Crate
- **Updated Cargo.toml**: Added missing dependencies (amp_physics, amp_gameplay)
- **Created prelude module**: Unified import point for commonly used types
- **Curated API surface**: Selected most important types for game development

```rust
// Before (deep imports)
use amp_gameplay::character::components::Player;
use amp_physics::{InterpolatedTransform, PhysicsSets};

// After (facade import)
use amp_foundation::prelude::{Player, InterpolatedTransform, PhysicsSets};
```

### 2. Added Deprecated Re-exports
- **amp_core::prelude**: Deprecated shim for compatibility
- **amp_math::prelude**: Deprecated shim for compatibility  
- **amp_physics::prelude**: Deprecated shim for compatibility

### 3. Migrated Camera System
- **File**: [`src/camera.rs`](file:///Users/bradyjeong/Documents/Projects/Amp/gta4/gta_game/src/camera.rs)
- **Before**: 3 separate import lines from different crates
- **After**: 1 clean import from amp_foundation::prelude
- **Result**: ✅ Compiles successfully with cleaner imports

### 4. Proof of Concept Demo
- **File**: [`examples/facade_migration_demo.rs`](file:///Users/bradyjeong/Documents/Projects/Amp/gta4/gta_game/examples/facade_migration_demo.rs)
- **Demonstrates**: All key types accessible through facade
- **Status**: ✅ Compiles and validates facade functionality

## Architecture Benefits

### Cleaner Imports
```rust
// OLD: Multiple deep imports
use amp_core::{Error, Result};
use amp_math::{Morton3D, Vec3};
use amp_physics::{InterpolatedTransform, PhysicsSets};
use amp_gameplay::character::components::Player;

// NEW: Single facade import
use amp_foundation::prelude::*;
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing deep imports still work (with deprecation warnings)
- Gradual migration path available
- No breaking changes to existing code

### Future Maintenance
- Single point to manage commonly used exports
- Easier to evolve API surface over time
- Clear separation between internal and public APIs

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (✅ COMPLETE)
- [x] Setup amp_foundation with prelude
- [x] Add deprecated shims in individual crates
- [x] Migrate one small system (camera) as proof of concept
- [x] Validate compilation and functionality

### Phase 2: Game Code Migration (Next)
- [ ] Migrate main.rs imports
- [ ] Migrate other game systems one by one
- [ ] Update examples and documentation
- [ ] Remove deprecated shims after full migration

### Phase 3: Internal Cleanup (Future)
- [ ] Migrate internal crate-to-crate dependencies
- [ ] Consolidate re-exports
- [ ] Optimize compilation dependencies

## Key Files Modified

1. [`crates/amp_foundation/Cargo.toml`](file:///Users/bradyjeong/Documents/Projects/Amp/gta4/gta_game/crates/amp_foundation/Cargo.toml#L9-L15) - Added dependencies
2. [`crates/amp_foundation/src/lib.rs`](file:///Users/bradyjeong/Documents/Projects/Amp/gta4/gta_game/crates/amp_foundation/src/lib.rs) - Created prelude module
3. [`src/camera.rs`](file:///Users/bradyjeong/Documents/Projects/Amp/gta4/gta_game/src/camera.rs#L5-L7) - Migrated to facade imports
4. [`Cargo.toml`](file:///Users/bradyjeong/Documents/Projects/Amp/gta4/gta_game/Cargo.toml#L133-L142) - Added amp_foundation dependency

## Validation Results

### ✅ Compilation Success
- `cargo check -p amp_foundation`: Clean compilation
- Camera system: Successfully uses facade imports
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Old import paths still work (with deprecation warnings)
- Existing code continues to function
- Gradual migration path available

### ✅ Developer Experience
- Cleaner, more intuitive imports
- Single source of truth for common types
- Better discoverability of Amp APIs

## Next Steps

1. **Migrate more game systems**: Start with main.rs and other simple systems
2. **Update documentation**: Show facade import patterns in examples
3. **Measure compilation impact**: Ensure facade doesn't slow builds
4. **Community feedback**: Get input on API surface choices
5. **Complete migration**: Eventually remove deprecated shims

## Oracle Alignment

This migration aligns with Oracle's facade strategy (ADR-0010) by:
- Providing cleaner API surfaces for external users
- Maintaining strategic modularity internally
- Following the gradual migration approach
- Preserving the 8-crate architecture integrity
