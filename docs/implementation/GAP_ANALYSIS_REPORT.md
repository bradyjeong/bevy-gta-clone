## Critical Missing Features

### üö® Priority 1 (Must Have)
1. **Water System** - Essential for open world
2. **Persistence System** - Save/load game state
3. **Advanced Spawn Budget Policy** - Frame rate stability

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 2 (Should Have)  
1. **Vegetation LOD System** - Performance optimization
2. **Mixamo Character Integration** - Enhanced character system
3. **Unified World Plugin** - Better world management orchestration

### üí° Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
1. **Advanced Input Mapping** - Enhanced input handling
2. **Legacy Feature Compatibility** - Smooth migration path

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Systems (2-3 weeks)
- Port water system from f430bc6-reference
- Implement persistence system with modern architecture  
- Enhance spawn budget policy with advanced features

### Phase 2: Performance Features (1-2 weeks)
- Add vegetation LOD system
- Integrate Mixamo character support
- Implement unified world orchestration

### Phase 3: Polish & Integration (1 week)
- Enhanced input mapping system
- Legacy feature compatibility layer
- Comprehensive testing and validation

## Restoration Approach

### Recommended Strategy: **Selective Modern Port**
1. **Cherry-pick** proven features from f430bc6-reference
2. **Modernize** implementation using current 8-crate architecture
3. **Enhance** with current advanced testing and documentation
4. **Integrate** with existing Sprint 9 optimizations

### Avoid: Direct Copy
- f430bc6-reference uses single-crate legacy architecture
- Current modern architecture is superior foundation
- Maintain current test coverage and performance optimizations

## Conclusion

**Current worktree** provides superior architecture and development practices, while **f430bc6-reference** contains proven AAA features that need selective porting. The gap analysis reveals **6 critical missing systems** that should be implemented to achieve feature parity while maintaining architectural advantages.
