## STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### A. Vertical Slices Approach
Re-enable one gameplay slice at a time, porting only the code each slice touches. Avoid monolithic rewrites.

### B. Δ-Coverage Testing
Every week add regression/unit/performance tests that lock in restored behavior. No feature without tests.

### C. Crate Boundary Stability
Maintain current 5-crate architecture. New code must live inside feature-specific sub-modules (e.g., amp_gameplay::vehicle).

### D. Two-Phase Migration
For systems with heavy API churn: 1) Adapter shims, 2) Full refactor. Minimize disruption.

### E. Performance Gates
Maintain fps ≥60 on reference scene with optimization improvements where possible. No test >200ms. Continuous performance monitoring.

### F. Integration Windows
Maintain compile green every Friday. Break-glass changes only behind feature flags.
