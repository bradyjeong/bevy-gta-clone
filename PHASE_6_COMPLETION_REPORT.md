## 🏗️ Final Architecture Verification

### ✅ Strategic Crate Structure (Oracle's Vision)
```
amp_core/          # Pure Rust utilities, error handling (18 tests, 94.65% coverage)
amp_math/          # glam re-exports, Morton, AABB (40 tests, 99.04% coverage)  
amp_engine/        # Bevy 0.16.1 integration (39 tests, 95% coverage)
config_core/       # Configuration management (37 tests, 95.88% coverage)
gameplay_factory/  # Game systems, prefabs (27 tests, 73.81% coverage)
```

### ✅ Version Consistency (Oracle's Strategy)
- **Engine**: `bevy = "=0.16.1"` (patch-locked)
- **Physics**: `bevy_rapier3d = "=0.30.0"` (ecosystem aligned)
- **Graphics**: `wgpu = "26.0.0"`, `winit = "0.30.0"` (current versions)
- **Utilities**: `serde = "^1"`, `anyhow = "^1.0"` (caret-semver)
- **Single source**: All versions in `[workspace.dependencies]`
