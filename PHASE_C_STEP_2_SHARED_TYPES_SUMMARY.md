# Oracle Phase C - Step 2: Shared Types Foundation Complete

## Summary
Successfully created the shared-types foundation in game_core as required by the Oracle's Phase C plan. This establishes the foundation that other crates (gameplay_sim, gameplay_render, gameplay_ui) will depend on.

## Files Moved to game_core

### Core Data Structures (Already Present)
- ✅ `game_state.rs` - GameState enum (Walking, Driving, Flying, Jetting)
- ✅ `constants.rs` - Physics collision groups (STATIC_GROUP, VEHICLE_GROUP, CHARACTER_GROUP)
- ✅ `config/` - Complete configuration system
  - ✅ `game_config.rs` - Main configuration data structures
  - ✅ `performance_config.rs` - Performance configuration data
  - ✅ `vehicle_config.rs` - Vehicle configuration data
  - ✅ `assets.rs` - Asset configuration paths
- ✅ `components/` - All component data structures
  - ✅ `player.rs` - Player data components (serializable)
  - ✅ `vehicles.rs` - Vehicle data components (serializable)
  - ✅ `world.rs` - World data components (serializable)
  - ✅ `effects.rs` - Effect data components (serializable)
  - ✅ `water.rs` - Water data components (serializable)
  - ✅ `lod.rs` - LOD data components (serializable)
  - ✅ `realistic_vehicle.rs` - Realistic vehicle data components
  - ✅ `dirty_flags.rs` - Dirty flag data components
  - ✅ `instanced_vegetation.rs` - Vegetation instancing data components
- ✅ `bundles.rs` - Component bundles (pure data composition)

### New Modules Added
- ✅ `persistence/` - Serialization and persistence data structures
  - ✅ `save_system.rs` - Core save/serialization types (SerializableTransform, SaveGameState)
  - ✅ `load_system.rs` - Load state management and utilities
  - ✅ `mod.rs` - Module organization
- ✅ `services/` - Simple service abstractions
  - ✅ `simple_services.rs` - ConfigService, PhysicsService (data/config only)
  - ✅ `mod.rs` - Module organization

### Library Updates
- ✅ Updated `game_core/src/lib.rs` to include persistence and services modules
- ✅ Updated `game_core/src/prelude.rs` to expose new modules
- ✅ Verified dependencies in `game_core/Cargo.toml`

## Dependencies Resolved
- All moved files use only basic dependencies (bevy, serde, chrono, ron)
- No circular dependencies created
- Clean separation of data structures from business logic
- Foundation ready for other crates to depend on

## Compilation Status
✅ `game_core` compiles successfully with only documentation warnings
✅ All shared types are now available for import by other crates
✅ Foundation established for Phase C Steps 3-5

## Next Steps Required
The shared-types foundation is now complete. The following Steps 3-5 can now proceed:

1. **Step 3**: Move gameplay_sim files (physics, movement, world simulation)
2. **Step 4**: Move gameplay_render files (rendering, effects, factories)  
3. **Step 5**: Move gameplay_ui files (UI, debug, performance monitoring)

Each subsequent step can now safely import from game_core without circular dependencies.

## Files Ready for Next Steps
According to extraction_map.yaml, the following categories are ready to be moved:
- **gameplay_sim**: 85+ files including physics, movement, world simulation, behavior systems
- **gameplay_render**: 25+ files including rendering, effects, factories, batching
- **gameplay_ui**: 20+ files including UI, debug, performance monitoring

The foundation is solid and ready for the remaining migration steps.
