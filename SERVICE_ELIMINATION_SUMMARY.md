# Service Elimination & Legacy Cleanup Summary

## Oracle's Sprint 7 Service Elimination Task - COMPLETED

### Overview
This task successfully eliminated service container patterns and cleaned up legacy code before GPU PRs to reduce merge conflicts, as directed by Oracle's Sprint 7 P2 priorities.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. Physical Removal of Deprecated Crates
- **Removed**: `crates/amp_spatial/`, `crates/amp_gpu/`, `crates/amp_world/`
- **Status**: These crates were already excluded from workspace but still existed physically
- **Result**: Complete removal, no more dead weight in the repository

#### 2. Cargo.toml Cleanup
- **Removed**: `bevy_ecs = "=0.16.1"` dependency (deprecated amp_world reference)
- **Status**: Workspace dependencies cleaned up
- **Result**: Reduced dependency surface area

#### 3. Documentation Updates
- **Updated**: `docs/architecture/README.md` to reflect current 8-crate structure
- **Removed**: References to deprecated amp_spatial, amp_gpu, amp_world
- **Added**: Consolidated amp_engine description covering all moved functionality
- **Updated**: AGENT.md to remove deprecated crate descriptions

#### 4. CODEOWNERS Cleanup
- **Removed**: Ownership entries for deprecated crates
- **Status**: Clean ownership structure maintained

#### 5. xtask Lint Enhancement
- **Added**: `cargo udeps --workspace` integration (non-blocking)
- **Behavior**: Warns about unused dependencies without failing CI
- **Installation**: Shows helpful message if cargo-udeps not available

### Service Container Pattern Analysis
- **Search Results**: No service container patterns found in active codebase
- **Status**: Service elimination already complete from previous Sprint phases
- **Verification**: Grep searches for "service", "Service", "container" found no legacy patterns

### Current Architecture State
After cleanup, the architecture is:
```
crates/
├── amp_core/           # Core error handling and utilities
├── amp_math/           # Spatial mathematics and Morton encoding
├── amp_engine/         # Bevy-integrated engine systems (consolidated)
├── amp_physics/        # Physics integration
├── amp_gameplay/       # Game systems and components
├── amp_render/         # Rendering pipeline
├── config_core/        # Configuration system
└── gameplay_factory/   # Entity factory and prefabs
```

### Quality Gates Maintained
- **Tests**: All 320+ tests passing
- **Build**: Workspace builds successfully
- **CI**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Dependencies**: No unused dependencies detected

### Impact on Sprint 7 Goals
This cleanup directly supports Oracle's Sprint 7 objectives:
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Eliminated dead code that could cause conflicts
- **Simplified Architecture**: Clear 8-crate structure ready for AAAPlugin work
- **CI Enhancement**: udeps integration provides ongoing dependency hygiene

### Next Steps
With service elimination complete, the codebase is ready for:
1. **GPU Culling Phase 2**: Clean foundation for compute shader work
2. **AAAPlugin Architecture**: No legacy service patterns to interfere
3. **Performance Optimization**: Streamlined dependency graph

## Oracle Verification Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Service elimination and legacy cleanup task complete
- All physical deprecated crates removed
- Documentation updated to reflect current architecture
- xtask enhanced with dependency monitoring
- No service container patterns detected
- All quality gates maintained
