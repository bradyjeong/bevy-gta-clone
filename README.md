### 🎮 **Main Game Application**

Due to compilation issues with amp_engine dependencies, see our comprehensive architectural specification:

**📖 [Main Application Architecture](docs/MAIN_APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

**🎮 Current Working Demo:**
```bash
cargo run --example city_demo_baseline --features rapier3d_030
```

This demonstrates all core systems working together: vehicle physics, audio, NPC behavior, and gameplay integration.

## Quick Start

### Using Facade Crates (Recommended)

```rust
// For game development - use amp_game facade
use amp_game::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .add_plugins(GameplayPlugins)
        .run();
}
```

```rust
// For engine building - use amp_foundation facade
use amp_foundation::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let position = Vec3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
    let aabb = AABB::from_center_size(position, Vec3::ONE);
    println!("AABB: {:?}", aabb);
}
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bradyjeong/bevy-gta-clone.git
cd bevy-gta-clone

# Build the workspace
cargo build --workspace

# Test facade crates
cargo test -p amp_foundation -p amp_game

# Run the city demo (post-migration)
cargo run --example city_demo

# Run full CI pipeline locally
./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh
```
