# Week 4: Hot-Reload Implementation for Config & Prefabs

## 📋 Task Overview
**Oracle Timeline:** Week 4 (Oracle-identified priority)
**Dependencies:** Component registry system (Week 3)
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 days

Implement comprehensive hot-reload functionality for both configuration files and prefab definitions, enabling live development workflow without game restarts.

## 🎯 Goals
- [ ] File watcher system for config and prefab files
- [ ] Live reloading of prefab definitions during gameplay
- [ ] Configuration hot-reload with validation
- [ ] Graceful error handling for malformed files
- [ ] Developer-friendly feedback and logging

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **File Watcher System**
   ```rust
   pub struct FileWatcher {
       watchers: HashMap<PathBuf, Box<dyn FileWatchHandler>>,
       debouncer: Debouncer,
   }
   ```

2. **Hot-Reload Manager**
   ```rust
   pub struct HotReloadManager {
       config_watcher: ConfigWatcher,
       prefab_watcher: PrefabWatcher,
       reload_queue: VecDeque<ReloadEvent>,
   }
   ```

3. **Reload Event System**
   ```rust
   pub enum ReloadEvent {
       ConfigChanged(PathBuf),
       PrefabChanged(PrefabId, PathBuf),
       ValidationError(ReloadError),
   }
   ```

### Implementation Details
- Use `notify` crate for cross-platform file watching
- Implement debouncing to handle rapid file changes
- Add validation pipeline for reloaded content
- Support selective reloading (config vs prefabs)
- Integrate with existing Factory and config systems

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] File changes detected within 100ms
- [ ] Successful reload of valid config/prefab files
- [ ] Error handling for invalid files (no crashes)
- [ ] Live entities update when prefabs change
- [ ] Configuration changes apply immediately

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Test coverage ≥70% (maintain current 80.43%)
- [ ] All tests pass with `cargo test --workspace`
- [ ] No compilation warnings with `-Dwarnings`
- [ ] CI build time remains <20 seconds
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] File change detection <100ms latency
- [ ] Reload processing <500ms for typical files
- [ ] No frame drops during reload operations
- [ ] Memory usage <10MB for watcher system
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple simultaneous changes

## 📝 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: File Watcher Foundation (2 days)
- Integrate `notify` crate for file watching
- Implement debouncing for rapid file changes
- Create cross-platform file watcher abstraction
- Add basic file change event handling

### Phase 2: Config Hot-Reload (2 days)
- Implement config file reloading
- Add validation pipeline for config changes
- Update `config_core` with hot-reload support
- Test configuration changes during gameplay

### Phase 3: Prefab Hot-Reload (2 days)
- Implement prefab file reloading
- Update Factory system to handle prefab changes
- Add live entity updates when prefabs change
- Test complex prefab modification scenarios

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Polish (1 day)
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add developer-friendly logging and feedback
- Create graceful fallback for invalid files
- Performance optimization and testing

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (1 day)
- Integrate with existing systems
- Update minimal example with hot-reload demo
- Cross-platform testing and validation
- Documentation and usage examples

## 🔗 Dependencies & Blockers

### Required Before Starting
- ✅ Component registry system (Week 3)
- ✅ RON loader and validation
- ✅ Factory pattern with prefab support

### Potential Blockers
- Cross-platform file watching compatibility
- Performance impact on gameplay systems
- Complex validation requirements for nested configs

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- File change detection reliability >99%
- Reload success rate >95% for valid files
- Error recovery rate >90% for invalid files
- Developer workflow improvement >50% (subjective)

### Performance Metrics
- File change latency <100ms
- Reload processing time <500ms
- No measurable FPS impact during reloads
- Memory usage <10MB for watcher system

## 🛠️ Technical Considerations

### File Watching Strategy
- Use `notify` crate for cross-platform support
- Implement debouncing (300ms) for rapid changes
- Support recursive directory watching
- Handle file system events (create, modify, delete)

### Validation Pipeline
- Validate syntax before applying changes
- Rollback on validation failures
- Provide clear error messages with line numbers
- Support partial validation for large files

### Live Update Strategy
- Queue reload events to avoid conflicts
- Process reloads during frame boundaries
- Update existing entities when prefabs change
- Maintain game state consistency

## 🎮 Usage Example
```rust
// Enable hot-reload in development
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
app.add_plugin(HotReloadPlugin::new()
    .watch_configs("assets/config/")
    .watch_prefabs("assets/prefabs/")
    .with_debounce(Duration::from_millis(300))
);

// Modify prefab file → automatic reload → live entity updates
```
