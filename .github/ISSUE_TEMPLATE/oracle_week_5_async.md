## üìã Task Overview
**Oracle Timeline:** Week 5+ (Oracle-identified priority)
**Dependencies:** Hot-reload implementation (Week 4)
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 days

Implement asynchronous prefab loading and integrate with a comprehensive asset pipeline for large-scale world streaming and performance optimization.

## üéØ Goals
- [ ] Async prefab loading without blocking main thread
- [ ] Asset pipeline integration for optimized loading
- [ ] Streaming prefab system for large worlds
- [ ] Memory management and prefab caching
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **Async Prefab Loader**
   ```rust
   pub struct AsyncPrefabLoader {
       load_queue: Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<LoadRequest>>>,
       cache: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<PrefabId, Arc<Prefab>>>>,
       executor: TaskPool,
   }
   ```

2. **Asset Pipeline Integration**
   ```rust
   pub struct AssetPipeline {
       processors: HashMap<String, Box<dyn AssetProcessor>>,
       cache: AssetCache,
       loader: AsyncLoader,
   }
   ```

3. **Streaming System**
   ```rust
   pub struct StreamingManager {
       active_regions: HashMap<RegionId, Vec<PrefabId>>,
       load_distance: f32,
       unload_distance: f32,
       priority_queue: BinaryHeap<LoadPriority>,
   }
   ```

## üéÆ Usage Example
```rust
// Configure async loading
let loader = AsyncPrefabLoader::new()
    .with_cache_size(1000)
    .with_priority_system(PrioritySystem::Distance)
    .with_streaming_distance(500.0);

// Load prefab asynchronously
let prefab_handle = loader.load_async("assets/prefabs/vehicle.ron").await?;

// Stream prefabs based on player position
streaming_manager.update_player_position(player_pos);
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for async loading components
- Integration tests with streaming scenarios
- Performance benchmarks for large prefab sets
- Memory leak detection and profiling
- Stress tests with rapid loading/unloading
