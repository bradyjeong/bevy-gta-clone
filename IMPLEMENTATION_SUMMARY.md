# IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY: ADR-0007 Complete → AAA Restoration Phase

## Summary

**ADR-0007 COMPLETE**: Oracle-guided strategic migration from bevy_ecs 0.13 + micro-crates to Bevy 0.16.1 + strategic modularity successfully completed.

**NOW ACTIVE**: AAA Restoration Phase - 12-week plan to restore f430bc6 "REVOLUTIONARY TRANSFORMATION" features to current Bevy 0.16.1 architecture.

## ADR-0007 Migration Results

### Architecture Transformation Complete
- **✅ Migration**: bevy_ecs 0.13 + micro-crates → Bevy 0.16.1 + strategic modularity
- **✅ Crate Structure**: 6-crate strategic architecture implemented
- **✅ Version Consistency**: Oracle's definitive strategy with automated guards
- **✅ Test Status**: 180+ tests passing across all crates
- **✅ Foundation**: Clean, professional Bevy 0.16.1 codebase ready

### Problems Resolved
- **✅ Ecosystem Alignment**: Full Bevy 0.16.1 stack integration
- **✅ Development Overhead**: Strategic crate boundaries eliminate coordination tax
- **✅ Future Risk**: Bevy ecosystem alignment ensures smooth upgrades
- **✅ Test Reliability**: Integrated App instances replace mocked ECS
