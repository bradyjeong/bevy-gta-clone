# IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY: Sprint 6 Complete → Sprint 7 Professional Integration

## Summary

**SPRINT 6 COMPLETE**: Oracle-guided Professional Integration & GPU Pipeline Activation successfully completed with all conditional approval requirements resolved.

**NOW ACTIVE**: Sprint 7 - GPU Culling Phase 2 + AAAPlugin Architecture implementation for complete professional integration.

## ADR-0007 Migration Results

### Sprint 6 Deliverables Complete
- **✅ Technical Debt Resolution**: All Oracle's identified production-blocking issues resolved
- **✅ GPU Pipeline Foundation**: ADR-0009 documented + feature-flagged infrastructure implemented
- **✅ Bevy Integration Enhancement**: InheritedVisibility checks added to render pipeline
- **✅ CI Infrastructure**: Weekly memory leak prevention + doctest stability achieved
- **✅ Config System Stability**: Field-level merge hierarchy working correctly
- **✅ Quality Gates**: All 320+ tests passing, zero clippy warnings, Oracle gate criteria met

### Problems Resolved
- **✅ Ecosystem Alignment**: Full Bevy 0.16.1 stack integration
- **✅ Development Overhead**: Strategic crate boundaries eliminate coordination tax
- **✅ Future Risk**: Bevy ecosystem alignment ensures smooth upgrades
- **✅ Test Reliability**: Integrated App instances replace mocked ECS
